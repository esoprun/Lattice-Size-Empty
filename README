This is MAGMA code accompanying paper "Lattice Size of Width One Lattice Polytopes in R^3" by Alajmi and Soprunova. The goal is to show that the standard basis in Example 6.1 in the paper is Minkowski reduced and that if rows of a 3 by 3 matrix A form a reduced basis of Z^3 then l_1(AP)\geq 14. 


Functions:

Barycenter(P) Finds the barycenter of a lattice polytope P in R^3.

Counterexample(P) Checks for Example 6.1 in [1] that there is no reduced basis that computes the lattice size of P=Polytope([[0,2,5],[0,-2,5],[0,1,-6],[1,-8,5],[1,2,-5],[1,-4,-3]]).

InRadius(P)  Finds the radius of the sphere inscribed in 3D lattice polytope P and centered at the barycenter of P.

L1(P) Given a lattice polytope P in R^3, computes l_1(P)=max(x+y+z)-min(x)-min(y)-min(z), where all the extrema are computed over (x,y,z) in P.
